# SudokuSolver

Sudoku solver that uses algorithms to figure out number consecutively rather than a backtracking approach written in
java.
The backtracking approach would be simpler to write and is the most standard approach to solve this problem, but the
challenge here is to solve this without backtracking.
The project does indeed include a sudoku solver which uses backtracking but that solver is to be used purely for testing
purposes.
It enables checking if the more complex algorithmic solver solves the sudoku correctly.
The backtracking solver is written by ChatGPT-4 Data Analysis.
